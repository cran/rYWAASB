Description: Proposes a new ranking algorithm that utilizes a "Y*WAASB" biplot generated from the 'metan' package. The aim of the package is to effectively distinguish the top-ranked genotypes. For a detailed explanation of the process of obtaining a "Y*WAASB" biplot and the related data, please refer to the manual included in this package as well as the study by Olivoto & LÃºcio (2020) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13384>. In this context, "WAASB" refers to the "Weighted Average of Absolute Scores" provided by Olivoto et al. (2019) <doi:10.2134/agronj2019.03.0220>, which quantifies the stability of genotypes across different environments using linear mixed-effect models. In order to run the package, it is necessary to extract the "WAASB" coefficients using the 'metan' package.
